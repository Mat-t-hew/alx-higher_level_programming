# HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTP Cookies

## HTTP Overview (Excluding Specifics)

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a stateless protocol that governs the transfer of hypermedia documents, such as HTML. Excluding specific elements like the "TRACE" request method, "CONNECT" request method, language negotiation, "Options MultiView," and character set negotiation, HTTP encompasses various methods for requesting and transferring data over the web.

## HTTP Cookies

HTTP Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by the web browser. These cookies serve multiple purposes in web applications, including session management, user tracking, and personalization. Cookies allow websites to remember user preferences and maintain stateful interactions, enhancing the overall user experience. However, they also raise privacy concerns, leading to various mechanisms and regulations to control their usage, such as SameSite attributes and GDPR compliance.
