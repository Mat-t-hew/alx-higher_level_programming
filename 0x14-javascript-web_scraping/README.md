**JavaScript**:
   JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development. It allows developers to create interactive elements on websites, handle events, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and more. In the context of web scraping, JavaScript can be used to parse and extract data from web pages.

2. **Web Scraping**:
   Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the HTML content of web pages and then parsing and extracting the desired information from that content. Web scraping can be done using various tools and techniques, including libraries like Cheerio and Puppeteer in JavaScript.

3. **Scripting**:
   Scripting involves writing scripts or small programs to automate tasks. In the context of web scraping, scripting is used to automate the process of fetching and extracting data from websites. JavaScript is commonly used for scripting web scraping tasks due to its ability to interact with web pages.

4. **API (Application Programming Interface)**:
   An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of web scraping, APIs can be used to fetch data from web servers in a structured format, such as JSON or XML. APIs often provide endpoints that accept HTTP requests and return data in a specified format.

5. **Working with JSON data**:
   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a web server and a client. JSON data consists of key-value pairs and is often used to represent structured data. In JavaScript, JSON data can be parsed and manipulated using built-in functions like `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.

6. **The workflow of accessing the attributes of a simply-created JSON object by Jimmy Tran from Cohort 1 - San Francisco**:
   This likely refers to a specific example or tutorial demonstrating how to work with JSON data in JavaScript. It may include creating a JSON object, accessing its attributes or properties, modifying the data, and serializing it back to JSON format.

7. **Request module**:
   The request module is a popular npm package for making HTTP requests in Node.js applications. It provides a simple and flexible API for sending HTTP requests and handling responses. The request module can be used in conjunction with web scraping to fetch HTML content from web pages for further processing.

8. **Modern JS**:
   "Modern JS" likely refers to modern JavaScript features and best practices, such as ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) syntax, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignment, and more. Modern JavaScript allows developers to write cleaner, more concise code and take advantage of new language features and improvements.
